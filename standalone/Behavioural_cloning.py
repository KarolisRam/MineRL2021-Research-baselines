"""
A baseline solution using behavioural cloning in the research track of NeurIPS 2021 MineRL Diamond competition.
With default parameters it trains in 15-20 mins on a machine with a GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU.
It uses less than 16GB RAM, achieves an average reward of 1.8 and sometimes obtains cobblestone (35 total reward).
You can adjust RAM usage to fit your specifications by changing the DATA_SAMPLES parameter below.
